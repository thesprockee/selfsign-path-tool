    Helper script to create new releases for the selfsign-path-tool project
.DESCRIPTION
    This script simplifies the process of creating new releases by automating
    version tagging and pushing to trigger the automated release workflow.
.PARAMETER Version
    The semantic version to release (e.g., 1.0.0, 2.1.3)
.PARAMETER Message
    Optional tag message. If not provided, a default message will be used.
.PARAMETER DryRun
    Show what would be done without actually creating the tag or pushing
.EXAMPLE
    .\create-release.ps1 1.0.0
    Create and push a v1.0.0 release tag
.EXAMPLE
    .\create-release.ps1 1.0.0 -Message "First stable release"
    Create a v1.0.0 tag with a custom message
.EXAMPLE
    .\create-release.ps1 2.1.0 -DryRun
    Show what would happen without actually creating the release
