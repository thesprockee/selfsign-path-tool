# This is a placeholder for the actual icon file
# In a real implementation, this would be a proper .ico file
# For now, we'll use a minimal 16x16 ICO format placeholder

# ICO Header (6 bytes)
# Reserved: 2 bytes (0x0000)
# Type: 2 bytes (0x0001 for ICO)
# Count: 2 bytes (0x0001 for 1 image)
# This file is a placeholder and must be replaced with a valid .ico file before building.
